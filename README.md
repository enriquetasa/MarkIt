# MarkIt

MarkIt is the application I made as my final year project while studying electronic engineering at The University of Manchester. It was completed between the months of February and April 2019 and it achieved a final grade of 83%.

The purpose of the application was to provide university staff with a tool to mark the work of students at laboratory sessions. The application consisted of a Windows app which allowed setting up of mark schemes, a Azure powered cloud backend to provide data services and cloud APIs and an Android app to do the marking and visualise the grades achieved. This repository includes both the Android and Windows apps as well as the final report I submitted for marking.

Feel free to have a look around and to contact me, leave comments or issue requests with things I could have done better - I'm all about learning how to write better code.
